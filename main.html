        <p class = "intro">Welcome to my website.</p>
        <p>This website will serve both as a way for me to explore 
        HTML/CSS/JavaScript and a place for me to display my work.  You can see my resume 
        on the "about me" page.</p>
        <p>I am a career changer who recently discovered his love for computer science.  
        Previously I earned a degree in economics for The University of Texas at Austin.  
        I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science at the same university.  
        Although I work full time, I try to make the best of my free time learning more about 
        computer science.</p>
        <p>I am currently enrolled in CS312, UT's introductory programming course in Java.  
        However, most of my learning so far has come from free online resources.  
        Some of my favorites include codeacademy, openculture, Khan Academy and WiBit.net. </p>
        <p>I created this website using Cloud9 IDE.  A free, cloud based IDE.  I am also 
        temporarily "hosting" this website with them.  Eventually I will move this website to 
        a dedicated host.</p>
